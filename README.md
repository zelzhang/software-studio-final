OpenFlappyBird
==============

An open source clone of a famous flappy bird game for Android using the amazing [AndEngine][1]

History
-------

When the original Flappy Bird game was removed from Google Play (and other well known app marketplaces), I, along with [thousands][2] of other unimaginative developers rushed to fill that void with our own crappy rip off clones. I must point out though that I merely saw this as an ideal excuse to learn how to use [AndEngine][1] rather than flood Google Play with [malware][3]. Incidently my clone (along with almost every other) was [removed][4] by Google rather swiftly! 

Anyway, in my pursuit of creating the perfect Flappy Bird clone I could find numerous fragmented tutorials, snippets and documentation on AndEngine but I found it frustratingly difficult to find actual examples of real, finished games that were open source - working code is after all the very best form of documentation. 

So, here is my slightly-rough-around-the-edges attempt to reproduce one of the most annoying yet popular games ever to hit mobile devices - I hope it can help some others to get to grips with game development on Android.

Instructions
--------
First check out the source of [AndEngine][5], add it to your Eclipse workspace as an Android library project. Check out the source for OpenFlappyBird and add it to your workspace - hopefully the reference to AndEngine should be ok if you have them both in the same directory. If not just remove the broken reference and add it again.

TODO
--------
  - Never did manage to finish the scoreboard stuff
  - Gradle-a-fy all teh things!
  - Maybe tidy things up, this was slapped together in 2 about evenings!
